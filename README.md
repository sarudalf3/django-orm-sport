# Django ORM (Object Relational Mapping)

Second part of ORM.  In this part, I made different queries using QuerySet language, in three levels.
The relationship is among legaues, teams and players, using reversing, filter, exclude and counts.

## Instructions from Coding Dojo

### Clone this repo for the CodingDojo Sports ORM assignments in the Django Level 2 curriculum.

`git clone https://github.com/madjaqk/sports_orm.git`

When you `python manage.py runserver` and naviate to localhost:8000, you should see a list of leagues, teams, and players.  Modify `apps/leagues/views.py` and/or `apps/leagues/templates/leagues/index.html` to change the displayed list.
